                    <p class="text-justify">Hi! My name is Iva Milkovski and I'm a student and also a web designer. I'm 20 years old and I'm currently studying at ICT. I'm originally from Bor, which is located in eastern Serbia, but right now I'm living in Belgrade. I graduated from a tourism oriented high school and decided that I definitely want to do programing instead of being a tour guide. I'm still a beginner at designing but I'm ready to learn and improve so that I can become a professional web designer.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Also if you want to contact me be free to write me an email. My email adress is <a id="link">ivamilkovski44@gmail.com.</a></p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Hope you enjoy this site! ðŸ–¤</p>
